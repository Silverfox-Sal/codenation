            <p class="textOne">Like most people, I had not heard of Walking Football. A few weeks after my 50th birthday, at a doctor's appointment, I was informed that my blood sugar levels had elevated significantly and therefore I was now officially classed as suffering from Type II Diabetes.  My GP provided me with new meal plan to help with my diet and suggested a change in my lifestyle to include more exercise. When I told the GP that I don't like gyms and, given that I had played team sports when I was younger, I preferred group activities over solo routines, he asked if I would be interested in Walking Football for the over 50s. "Walking Football! What's that?" was my first response, and the rest, as they say, is history.<br> 
                <br>I went online to see if there was a local team I could join and was pleasantly surprised at how popular the game was and even more surprised to find that my local council leisure centre in North London offered weekly walking football sessions for the over 50s.  I went for a free trial session and shocked to find myself completely exhausted after 40 minutes. It was a bit of a rude awakening as I had under-estimated just how active the combination of walking and football can be. I had always been passionate about football and the thought of now being able to once again play the game I loved, albeit in a slightly different format, thrilled me to bits. I started playing it regularly and after just a few weeks began to notice a difference in my overall health; I was no longer out of breath, I had lost some weight, feeling a lot fitter physically and, last but certainly not least, was on an emotional / mental high.<br> 
                <br>These sessions were actually run by official coaches from the Tottenham Hotspur Football Club as part of their CSR initiatives to engage and work with the local comminities. This was an added bonus for me as, being a North Londoner, I am a lifelong Spurs fan. Through these sessions I met a lot of new people of similar age group, though at first I was the baby of the group, and formed new friendships both on & off the pitch, as a number of us now also play golf on a regular basis. I fell in love with the game, and every week looked forward to the next session counting down the days and soon became one of the regular players. About 6 months later, I had a routine blood test and was shocked to find that my elevated sugar levels had dropped from 85 to below the official threshold of 48 for Type II Diabetes. As a result of my changed diet and regular participation in walking football, I can safely say that I am not longer diabetic...though the doctor has advised me to not become complacent and to continue with this new rotine. These are just a few examples of teh benefits that I experienced personally.  I have heard stories from colleagues who have benefited in many other ways.  The chart on the right lists all the benefits that walking football can offer. <br>
                <br>Being able to reverse Type II Diabetes is a result in itself, but my walking football journey was to get better when the Spurs coaches informed me that they had selected me to play for Spurs in an upcoming tournament.  You can imagine how excited I was to hear this news.  I was then told that I had been appointed the team captain and would be the team spokesperson for media activities. This was a real honour for me to represent the club both on & off the pitch, a club that I have been supporting since I was a child. Over the last 3 years, I have proudly represented Spurs in many tournaments and participated in various events related to walking football. I have helped to form and run a local club of our own for the over 50s, called "R.I.P Walking Football FC", which playes regular sessions on Mondays and Thurdays (see Contact page for more details).  <br> 
                <br>And no, you are wrong, <b>R.I.P</b> actually stands for <b>"Running is Prohibited"!!!</b>  After all, it IS a 'walking' football club, right?  ;-)
