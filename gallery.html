            <p class="textOne">This page showcases a number of Walking Football related events that I have been fortunate enough to participate in. These include league matches, local and international tournaments for which I was selected to be captain of the Tottenham Hotspur team, a real honor for me as I have been supporting Spurs since I was 12 yrs old. I have really enjoyed taking part in all of these events and have made lots of new friends along the way.</p>

            <p class="textOne">Walking Football as an organised sport is still in its infancy; however a number of governing bodies are jostling for position to become affiliated with the FA at the national level and also with FIFA globally. The main governing body in the UK is the <b>WFA (Walking Football Association)</b> which has also formed the <b>FIWFA (Federation of International Walking Football Associations)</b> which is currently NOT recognised by FIFA. There is another similar organisation called the <b>IWFF (International Walking Football Federation)</b> which also claims to be the official global governing body for the game. Both the FIWFA and IWFF are planning to stage separate World Cup events in the summer of 2021, but this is subject to Covid-19 restrictions being lifted.<br> <br>For more information, please click the corresponding logo below to visit their respective website. The WFA website in particular has a cool feature that helps you to locate the nearest Walking Football club to your location and also provides contact details and timings of their sessions.  Good Luck!
