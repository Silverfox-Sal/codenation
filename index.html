            <p class="textOne">Walking football is currently the fastest growing sport in the UK. Just over 3 years ago, there were less than a hundred clubs in the country that facilitated walking football for the over 50s.  Today, that number is over 1500!!!  So, <b>what exactly is Walking Football</b>, you may be wondering.  
Well, it is very much like 5-a-side football with a couple of key differences. First and foremost, as the name suggests, running is not allowed. Players must walk at all times and ensure that at least one foot is in contact with the ground at all times. If a player is deemed to be running then the referee awards a free kick to the opposing team. A repeat offender is warned and if the running persists then that player can be either sin-binned for a few minutes or ejected from the game entirely.
The second difference is that as it is aimed at the over 50's it is a non-contact sport; as such no tackling is allowed. In addition to these 2 major differences, the ball cannot go above head height (no headers allowed), instead of throw-ins we have kick-ins whenever the ball goes out of play, the goalkeeper cannot step outside of his 'D' area and an outfield player cannot the enter the 'D' area. Some clubs optionally play a 3 touch rule which means that a player cannot touch the ball more than 3 times otherwise a free kick is awarded to the opposition; the count is reset as soon as another player has touched the ball. This makes the game flow fast and can be very exhausting. <br> 
<br>The game was primarily devised to encourage people over the age of 50 to engage in physical exercise in a fun way and become more active. The popularity of the sport has resulted in further categories being created to level the playing field; as aresult, that there are now leagues and tournaments for the over 50s, over 60s and even over 70s categories. Also, the sport is attracting many women over 50 years of age to play alongside men in mixed teams. 
It can be played indoors, typically in a school sports hall or a leisure centre, but mostly it is played outdoors on 5-a-side (3G/4G) artificial grass pitches such as those typically found at venues like PowerLeague or Goals etc. The game has gone global with new clubs and organisations being formed in many countries across the world as more people, and in particular doctors and health professionals, are becoming aware of the many <a href="about.html" target="_self">benefits of playing walking football</a>. <br> <br>So if you thought your playing days were well and truly behind you and you've hung up your boots then think again...It's never too late to start playing again, and remember: <b>Don't knock it until you try it!</b>

            <p class="textOne">Walking Football as an organised sport is still in its infancy; however a number of governing bodies are jostling for position to become affiliated with the FA at the national level and also with FIFA globally. The main governing body in the UK is the <b>WFA (Walking Football Association)</b> which has also formed the <b>FIWFA (Federation of International Walking Football Associations)</b> which is currently NOT recognised by FIFA. There is another similar organisation called the <b>IWFF (International Walking Football Federation)</b> which also claims to be the official global governing body for the game. Both the FIWFA and IWFF are planning to stage separate World Cup events in the summer of 2021, but this is subject to Covid-19 restrictions being lifted.<br> <br>For more information, please click the corresponding logo below to visit their respective website. The WFA website in particular has a cool feature that helps you to locate the nearest Walking Football club to your location and also provides contact details and timings of their sessions.  Good Luck!
